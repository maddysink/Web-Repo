<h1>Care Instructions</h1>
<p>There are many things that you must know to take care of your furry friend!</p>
<h2>Food and Water</h2>
<p>Cats need a combonation of both dry kibble food and wet canned food to live a happy and healthy life.</p>
<p>Additionally, cats enjoy drinking from running water, and often refuse to drink out of still water.</p>
<p>We recommend a flowing water fountain for your kitty!</p>
<h2>Toys</h2>
<p>There are many different toys you can buy for your cat.  However, not all toys are created equal. Cats need</p>
<p>enriching and entertaining toys that will utilize their brains and keep them active. We have found puzzle toys and cat nip toys work best.</p>
<h2>Sleep</h2>
<p>Cats need a lot of sleep! In fact, most kitties sleep around 15 hours a day. Sometimes it can be frustrating</p>
<p>when your cat sleeps all day and parties all night, but cats are naturally nocturnal so there is little you can do.</p>
<p>Try playing extra with your cat right before bed to tire them out, or give them some kitty safe melatonin.</p>
