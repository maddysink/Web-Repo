<h1>What to Know Before Adopting</h1>
<p>There is a lot you should know about living with a cat before you decide to adopt.</p>
<h2>Know When to Give Your Cat Space</h2>
<p>Often times your cat will need personal space and will not want to be touched.  Your cat may hiss, scratch, or slap you,</p>
<p>but do not be offended.  It is really difficult to tell when your cat does not want affection.</p>
<h2>Nighttime Activity</h2>
<p>Something you may not know about cats is that they are nocturnal and most active at dawn and dusk.  This means your cat will</p>
<p>want more attention at these times.  Kitties often get the nighttime zoomies, in which they run around like crazy at night.</p>
<p>There is not much you can do to curb this behavior, except to ignore them when they behave this way.</p>
<h2>Insider Tips and Tricks</h2>
<p>Giving your cat extra attention before bed can reduce the risk of an early morning wakeup or nighttime zoomies.</p>
<p>Do not pick your kitty up from the stomach, as this is extremely uncomfortable for them.</p>
