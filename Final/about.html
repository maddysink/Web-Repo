      <h3>About the Photographer</h3>
      <p>Hello! My name is Madeline Sinkovic.  I am a Boulder, Colorado based photographer specializing in artistic photography and natural setting portraiture.  I love to capture the world around me, especially different forms of water and its expression.  I fell in love with photography my freshman year of high school, when I began taking classes for art.  I have gained many years of experience since then, and have been operating Sinktography since March of 2020. </p>
      <p>I grew up all over the world, moving every couple of years.  From a very young age, I was exposed to many different, vibrant cultures and gained an appreciation for the world around me.  I believe growing up overseas has made me the person and photographer I am today.  My family now resides in Houston, Texas and I love to go visit... the food is amazing!</p>
      <p>Currently, I am opperating out of Boulder, Colorado while I attend the University of Colorado studying Creative Technology and Design Engineering.</p>
